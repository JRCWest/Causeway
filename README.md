# Causeway
###### A game for Blinks, by Jonathan West.

You are lumbering giants, battling for tiny territory!  Shape the landscape to meet the needs of your clan.  Whoever manages to claim the biggest peice of land is declared the winner.

## RULES

| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 12 +           | 2 - 6             |  ~ 5-10 minutes    | 12 & Up          |

There are no turns in Causeway - each giant must battle for land in real time.  Aside from that, there are no rules.  Use whatever tactics you have at your disposal to claim the new land (or the land of your enemies).

## SETUP
Arrange blinks in one large group.  This will be your battleground.  The shape of the group doesn't matter too much, but a more symmetrical shape may be helpful for keeping the game as fair as possible.  All pieces should start off as white.

Each player takes one piece from the land mass.  Single pressing the button will cycle through the 6 available colors.  Players choose one of these colors to represent their "clan".

## GAMEPLAY
All players begin at the same time, attaching their initial piece to the larger land mass.  Pressing the button of any other piece will cycle through it's colors, and you claim land by connecting pieces of the same color.  But be warned - each piece has had the order of those colors shuffled!  Players may move pieces around on the board as they see fit, but the board must remain one solid mass.

When two or more pieces of the same color are connected, a "lock-down" timer will begin ticking.  The pieces must stay connected and of the same color for the duration of the timer before the land can officially be claimed for your clan.  Protect your land during this vulnerable period at all costs - *the more times the colors are cycled through, the shorter this timer will last*.

## WIN CONDITION
The game ends when all pieces have been "locked-down".  At this point, no player may move pieces.  Players each count the pieces of land they managed to connect - whoever holds the single largest connected territory is named the winner.

Long press any locked tiles to return it to the default "white" color.
